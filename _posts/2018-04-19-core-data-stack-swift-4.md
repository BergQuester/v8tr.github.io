*Core Data* is Apple's object graph management and persistency framework. When it comes to structured data persistence, *Core Data* is an obvious choice. The goal of this article is to give you an overview of the *Core Data* architecture as well as to provide a list of basic operations together with working examples to help you get off to a quick start.

### Core Data Architecture

The main building blocks of *Core Data* are: `NSManagedObject`, `NSManagedObjectModel`, `NSPersistentStoreCoordinator` and `NSManagedObjectContext`. When connected together, they are usually referred to as a **Core Data stack**.

</p>

---

`NSManagedObject`'s are the model objects exposed by *Core Data*.

---

`NSManagedObjectModel` is a database schema that describes the application's entities. It defines the structure of the *managed objects*.

---

`NSPersistentStoreCoordinator` associates *persistent storage* and *managed object model*. It lends itself to mapping the data from the storage, say SQLite data base rows, into the object model. It is a task of high complexity and is often taken for granted when working with *Core Data*.

What is more, the *persistent coordinator* is used by the *managed object context* when it comes to saving or fetching objects.

---

`NSManagedObjectContext` controls the life cycle of the managed objects and provides operations to create, save and fetch them. You can think of the managed object context as a scratch pad with a group of managed objects.

### Persistent Container

Starting from iOS 10, `NSPersistentContainer` is responsible for creation and management of the *Core Data stack*.

`NSPersistentContainer` exposes a *managed object model*, a *managed object context* and a *persistent store coordinator* as well as provides many convenience methods when working them, especially when it comes to multithreaded applications.

Let's briefly go through the `NSPersistentContainer`'s interface.

#### Initialization

`init(name:)`  
initialize `NSPersistentContainer` with a given name. Make sure it matches with the name of your data model file.

---

`loadPersistentStores(completionHandler:)`   
asynchronously loads persistent stores and fires the completion handler once the stack is ready for use. Must be called after the persistent container has been initialized.

#### Working with Contexts

`newBackgroundContext()`  
creates a [private][private-concurrency-type] managed object context associated with `NSPersistentStoreCoordinator` directly.

---

`viewContext`  
a reference to the managed object context associated with the main queue. It is created automatically during the initialization process. This context is directly connected to a `NSPersistentStoreCoordinator`, thus it might freeze your application when performing heavy operations.

---

`performBackgroundTask(_:)`  
runs passed block on a newly created background context. Each time this method is called, a new background `NSManagedObjectContext` will be created.

### Setting Up the Stack

To be able to use *Core Data*, we first have to create a data model schema that describes the structure of our data.

To create a new *Data Model* file, go to *"File > New"* and choose *"Data Model"* from the *Core Data* section. Then add an entity `Item` with a single `name` attribute as shown below.

<p align="center">
    <img src="{{ "/img/core_data_stack_3.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="Core Data stack Architecture - Model Schema"/>
</p>

Having the *data model* created, we can now initialize the *Core Data* stack and see how the components play together.

{% highlight swift linenos %}
let persistentContainer = NSPersistentContainer(name: "Model")

persistentContainer.loadPersistentStores { storeDescription, error in
    if let error = error {
        assertionFailure(error.localizedDescription)
    }
    print("Core Data stack has been initialized with description: \(storeDescription)")
}
{% endhighlight %}

Which prints to console: `Core Data stack has been initialized with description: <NSPersistentStoreDescription: 0x102a69b70> (type: SQLite, url: <...>/CoreData_Article/Model.sqlite)`. This means the *Core Data* stack has been fully initialized and can be used in our app. By default the stack uses an *SQLite* persistent store, however it can be configured to use other types of storage.

*Tip: consider using `InMemory` persistent store for unit tests to ensure that the test data is properly cleaned up and each test is isolated.*

### Accessing the Context

An `NSPersistentStoreCoordinator` already comes with a ready for use view context:

```swift
let context = persistentContainer.viewContext
```

{: .box-note}
*Here and next we are using the view context that works on the main queue. Please note that the use of CPU-heavy computations on the main queue will lead to freezes in your app. Consider using `newBackgroundContext` or `performBackgroundTask(_:)` to perform such tasks in the background.*

### Creating Entity

As discussed at the beginning, all `ManagedObject`s live within a managed object context. Thus, to create a new `Item` instance we have to do this via a context:

```swift
let item = NSEntityDescription.insertNewObject(forEntityName: "Item", into: context) as! Item
```

### Saving Entity

Newly created managed objects have all their properties set to `nil`. Before saving the item to the data base, we will set a name for it:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
item.name = "Some item"
try! context.save()
{% endhighlight %}

### Fetching Entities

*Core Data* provides a way to construct complex search requests by means of `NSFetchRequest`. Let's define a fetch request that returns all saved items and pass it to the managed object context.

{% highlight swift linenos %}
let itemsFetchRequest = NSFetchRequest<NSFetchRequestResult>(entityName: "Item")
let fetchedItems = try! context.fetch(itemsFetchRequest) as! [Item]
print("Fetched items: \(fetchedItems)")
{% endhighlight %}

This snippet prints:

```
Fetched items: [<Item: 0x101a59f40> (entity: Item; id: 0x40000b <x-coredata://C13322AF-CF64-4AC4-8DEB-24B3E250A0B3/Item/p1> ; data: {
    name = "Some item";
})]
```

*Core Data* does not guarantee any specific order for the fetch results. It is possible to define complex sorting and filtering criterion which is essential when working with *Core Data*. A more detailed look at this topic is outside of the current article's scope, so I recommend checking [`NSFetchRequest` docs][fetch-request-docs] as well as [Fetching Managed Objects article by Apple][fetching-managed-objects-article].

### Deleting Entity

By now we have saved and fetched an `Item` instance. Deletion can be done as simple as follows:

```swift
context.delete(item)
```

### Rollbacking Deletion

All changes in the managed object context, up to the most recent save, can be undone by means of the *rollback* method.

```swift
context.rollback()
```

Now the deleted item is back into the context.

### Undoing Edition

The undo operation comes in hand when you need to cancel edition of the managed object's attribute. Let's change the item's name and then undo that change:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
item.name = "Another name"

print(item.name!)

context.undoManager = UndoManager()
context.undo()

print(item.name!)
{% endhighlight %}

Which prints:

```
Another name
Some item
```

### Source Code

The code snippets from the article can be found in this [sample project][sample-project]. You might want to clone it and make some tweaks to get a better understanding of the discussed topics.

### Conclusion

We have discussed the components of the *Core Data* framework and how do they play together.

We have initialized the Core Data stack by means of `NSPersistentContainer`, which takes lots of responsibilities for the stack creation and management off the developers' shoulders. We have also performed the basic operations with managed objects, such as *save, fetch, delete, rollback* and *undo*.

Even though there are plenty of other complex things *Core Data* has up on its sleeve, this article makes a nice foundation to get you off to a flying start.
