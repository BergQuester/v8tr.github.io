Although Swift has no language features for defining atomic properties, their lack is compensated with the diversity of locking APIs available in Apple's frameworks. In this article let's take a look at different ways of designing atomic properties in Swift.

First off, make sure we understand the core concepts related to *concurrent programming* and *atomicity*.

### Concurrency and Multitasking

**Concurrency** refers to the ability of different parts of a program to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome. 

This allows for **multitasking** which is a parallel execution of the concurrent units that significantly boosts performance of a program in multi-processor systems.

### Synchronization

In common sense, **synchronization** means making two things happen at the same time. 

In programming, **synchronization** has broader definition: it refers to relationships among events — any number of events, and any kind of relationship (before, during, after).

As programmers, we are often concerned with *synchronization constraints*, which are requirements pertaining to the order of events. 

Example of a constraint: *Events A and B must not happen at the same time*.

### What is Atomicity

An operation is **atomic** if it appears to the rest of the system to occur at a single instant without being interrupted. An *atomic* operation can either complete or return to its original state.

*Atomicity* is a safety measure which enforces that operations do not complete in an unpredictable way when accessed by multiple threads or processes simultaneously.

On a software level, a common tool to enforce *atomicity* is *lock*.

### Locks

When dealing with iOS apps, we are always sandboxed to their *processes*. A process creates and manages *threads*, which are the main building blocks in multitasking iOS applications.

**Lock** is an abstract concept for threads synchronization. The main idea is to protect access to a given region of code at a time. Different kinds of locks exist:
1. **Semaphore** — allows up to *N* threads to access a given region of code at a time.
2. **Mutex** — ensures that only one thread is active in a given region of code at a time. You can think of it as a *semaphore* with a *maximum count of 1*.
3. **Spinlock** — causes a thread trying to acquire a lock to wait in a loop while checking if the lock is available. It is efficient if waiting is rare, but wasteful if waiting is common.
4. **Read-write lock** — provides concurrent access for *read-only* operations, but exclusive access for *write* operations. Efficient when reading is common and writing is rare.
5. **Recursive lock** — a *mutex* that can be acquired by the same thread many times.

### Overview of Apple Locking APIs

#### Lock

`NSLock` and its companion `NSRecursiveLock` are Objective-C lock classes. They correspond to *Mutex* and *Recursive Lock* and don't have their Swift counterparts. 

A lower-level C `pthread_mutex_t` is also available in Swift. It can be configured both as a mutex and a recursive lock.

#### Spinlock

`OSSpinLock` has been deprecated in iOS 10 and now there is no exact match to a spinlock in Swift. The closest replacement is `os_unfair_lock` which doesn't spin on contention, but instead waits in the kernel to be awoken by an unlock. Thus, it has lower CPU impact than the spinlock does, but makes [starvation of waiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) a possibility.

#### Read-write lock

`pthread_rwlock_t` is a lower-level read-write lock that can be used in Swift.

### Semaphore

`DispatchSemaphore` provides an implementation of a semaphore. It is listed here for the sake of completeness, as it makes little sense to use semaphore for designing atomic properties.

### Implementing Atomic Property using Locks

After learning about concurrent programming and locks, let's implement our own atomic properties by means of Apple's locking APIs.

The main bullet points from the above code are:
1. Instead of using different locking APIs directly, we wrap them into classes conforming to the `Lock` interface: `SpinLock` and `Mutex`.
2. `AtomicProperty` is a simple class that has atomic property `foo` backed by `underlyingFoo` under the hood.
3. By means of lock / unlock dance we create a critical section that accesses `underlyingFoo`.
4. We create separate wrapper for read-write lock, as it needs different locking APIs to be used for setter and getter.

*Despite POSIX pthread locks are value types, you should not copy them both explicitly with the assignment operator or implicitly by capturing them in a closure or embedding in another value type. In POSIX, the behavior of the copy is undefined. That's why locks are wrapped into Class, not Struct.*

### Implementing Atomic Property using queues

Besides locks, Swift has `DispatchQueue` and `OperationQueue` that also can be used to design an atomic property.

Both queues are used to manage the execution of work items and they can configured to achieve lock behavior. The examples are below.

### Wrapping Up

Atomic operations appear to be instant from the perspective of all other threads in the app.

Despite Swift lacks default language traits for creating atomic property, it can be easily achieved with a number of available locking APIs. `NSLock`, dispatch and operation queues and multiple POSIX types are the most notable ones.

When dealing with POSIX locks, a rule of thumb is not to copy them and wrap in Swift APIs hiding implementation details.
