In this article you will learn how to implement custom display animations for table view cells by means of UIKit framework.

### Problem Statement

Animations are among the key factors that distinguish between the regular and outstanding user experience.

I'd venture to guess that you are using at least one table view in your current project. Taking into account that table views are so widely adopted in iOS apps, developing eye-catching cells loading animation can significantly boost your app's user experience. 

So how can we bring new value to your app by writing just a few lines of code?

### Getting Started

First off, grab [the starter project][starter-repo] to save some time on boilerplate code and initial setup. If you run it, you see regular `UITableView` with static cells.

<p align="center">
    <a href="{{ "/img/tableviewcell-display-animation/starter.png" | absolute_url }}">
        <img src="/img/tableviewcell-display-animation/starter.png" width="400" alt="Animating Table View Cell Display: Practical Recipes - Starter Project"/>
    </a>
</p>

When you open `TableViewController.swift`, you see several stubs needed for our further work:

{% highlight swift linenos %}

@IBAction func onRefresh(_ sender: UIBarButtonItem) {
    // Refresh table view here
}

override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, willDisplay cell: UITableViewCell, forRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
    // Add animations here
}

{% endhighlight %}

The `onRefresh` method handles taps on right navigation bar button. Later on we'll add the code that triggers animations, but for now let's leave it intact.

All the action will happen in  `tableView(_:,willDisplay:,forRowAt:)`. Let's add some simples animation to see it working.

### Implementing Simple Animation

Let's begin with a simple fade animation. `UIView` has a [family of methods](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622418-animate) that lend themselves to animating views. 

Add this code to `tableView(_:,willDisplay:,forRowAt:)`:

{% highlight swift linenos %}

cell.alpha = 0

UIView.animate(
    withDuration: 0.5,
    delay: 0.05 * Double(indexPath.row),
    animations: {
        cell.alpha = 1
})

{% endhighlight %}

Now run the project and see the animation in action.

<p align="center">
    <a href="{{ "/img/tableviewcell-display-animation/simple-animation.gif" | absolute_url }}">
        <img src="/img/tableviewcell-display-animation/simple-animation.gif" alt="Animating Table View Cell Display: Practical Recipes - Simple Animation"/>
    </a>
</p>

### Preparing for More Complex Animations

When implementing animations, it is often difficult to judge how good it is just by looking at the code. Most of the time you need to try a number of variations before coming up with a satisfying solution.

As a good developer, you want to follow best practices to produce a reusable solution that allows to easily plug in and tweak animations. This section lends itself to developing such foundation.

The first thing we do is defining `Animation` type that is essentially a closure that accepts several parameters:

{% highlight swift linenos %}

typealias Animation = (UITableViewCell, IndexPath, UITableView) -> Void

{% endhighlight %}

`Animator` lends itself to running animation. It also ensures that the animation does not run more than once for all visible cells.

{: .box-note}
*Experiment with `Animator` class and remove the usage of `hasAnimatedAllCells` property to see how the scroll behavior will change.*

{% highlight swift linenos %}

final class Animator {
    private var hasAnimatedAllCells = false
    private let animation: Animation

    init(animation: @escaping Animation) {
        self.animation = animation
    }

    func animate(cell: UITableViewCell, at indexPath: IndexPath, in tableView: UITableView) {
        guard !hasAnimatedAllCells else {
            return
        }

        animation(cell, indexPath, tableView)

        hasAnimatedAllCells = tableView.isLastVisibleCell(at: indexPath)
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Now we want to be as flexible as possible with our animations to tweak and replace them with ease. For this purpose let's implement `AnimationFactory` that creates animations themselves. The factory already has our fade animations added:

{% highlight swift linenos %}

enum AnimationFactory {

    static func makeFadeAnimation(duration: TimeInterval, delayFactor: Double) -> Animation {
        return { cell, indexPath, _ in
            cell.alpha = 0

            UIView.animate(
                withDuration: duration,
                delay: delayFactor * Double(indexPath.row),
                animations: {
                    cell.alpha = 1
            })
        }
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Replace old animation code in `TableViewController.swift`.

{% highlight swift linenos %}

override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, willDisplay cell: UITableViewCell, forRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
    let animation = AnimationFactory.makeFadeAnimation(duration: 0.5, delayFactor: 0.05)
    let animator = Animator(animation: animation)
    animator.animate(cell: cell, at: indexPath, in: tableView)
}

{% endhighlight %}

Run the project to verify that everything is working as expected.

Great job at refactoring old non-reusable animation code and replacing it with the new fancy one. Now you are ready for more cool stuff.

### Bounce Animation

To implement more complex animations you want to utilize `transform` property of `UITableViewCell` that applies 2D transformations to the cell, such as rotate, scale, move, or skew. That's what we are going to do for our next bouncing animation.

`UIKit` is powerful enough to let you define bounce animation by means of a single method. Remember that we put all new animation code into factory class. Open `AnimationFactory.swift` and add next method:

{% highlight swift linenos %}

static func makeMoveUpWithBounce(rowHeight: CGFloat, duration: TimeInterval, delayFactor: Double) -> Animation {
    return { cell, indexPath, tableView in
        cell.transform = CGAffineTransform(translationX: 0, y: rowHeight)

        UIView.animate(
            withDuration: duration,
            delay: delayFactor * Double(indexPath.row),
            usingSpringWithDamping: 0.4,
            initialSpringVelocity: 0.1,
            options: [.curveEaseInOut],
            animations: {
                cell.transform = CGAffineTransform(translationX: 0, y: 0)
        })
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Few highlights:
* `dampingRatio` - essentially a bouncing power. Use value of 1 for no bouncing at all and values closer to 0 to increase oscillation.
* `velocity` - spring velocity. Value of 1 corresponds to the total animation distance travelled within a second.
* `options` - options for animating views. We are using `.curveEaseInOut` to cause the animation to begin slowly, accelerate through the middle of its duration, and then slow again before completing.

The numbers we pass to the animation method were obtained empirically by tweaking the animation.

{: .box-note}
*Tip: try passing different [options](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/animationoptions) to see how they affect cells animation.*

Update code inside table view controller to replace fade animation with the new bouncing one.

{% highlight swift linenos %}

let animation = AnimationFactory.makeMoveUpWithBounce(rowHeight: cell.frame.height, duration: 1.0, delayFactor: 0.05)
let animator = Animator(animation: animation)
animator.animate(cell: cell, at: indexPath, in: tableView)

{% endhighlight %}

The animation produces the effect like this:

<p align="center">
    <a href="{{ "/img/tableviewcell-display-animation/bounce-animation.gif" | absolute_url }}">
        <img src="/img/tableviewcell-display-animation/bounce-animation.gif" alt="Animating Table View Cell Display: Practical Recipes - Bounce Animation"/>
    </a>
</p>

### Move and Fade Animation

Our next animation does two things: it moves the cells and fades them at the same time. For that purpose we use both `transform` and `alpha` properties of `UITableViewCell`.

{% highlight swift linenos %}

static func makeMoveUpWithFade(rowHeight: CGFloat, duration: TimeInterval, delayFactor: Double) -> Animation {
    return { cell, indexPath, _ in
        cell.transform = CGAffineTransform(translationX: 0, y: rowHeight / 2)
        cell.alpha = 0

        UIView.animate(
            withDuration: duration,
            delay: delayFactor * Double(indexPath.row),
            options: [.curveEaseInOut],
            animations: {
                cell.transform = CGAffineTransform(translationX: 0, y: 0)
                cell.alpha = 1
        })
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Put the new animation code in table view controller like we did before and run the app. Here is how the animation is supposed to look:

<p align="center">
    <a href="{{ "/img/tableviewcell-display-animation/move-and-fade-animation.gif" | absolute_url }}">
        <img src="/img/tableviewcell-display-animation/move-and-fade-animation.gif" alt="Animating Table View Cell Display: Practical Recipes - Move and Fade Animation"/>
    </a>
</p>

### Slide in Animation

I am sure you have already gotten a knack of writing the animations and started appreciating that reusable solution you've built before.

Slide in animation does merely what its name suggests: it moves cells from the right edge of the screen to their actual positions in a table. We also use `transform` property for this purpose.

Now add next animation code to our factory.

{% highlight swift linenos %}

static func makeSlideIn(rowHeight: CGFloat, duration: TimeInterval, delayFactor: Double) -> Animation {
    return { cell, indexPath, tableView in
        cell.transform = CGAffineTransform(translationX: tableView.bounds.width, y: 0)

        UIView.animate(
            withDuration: duration,
            delay: delayFactor * Double(indexPath.row),
            options: [.curveEaseInOut],
            animations: {
                cell.transform = CGAffineTransform(translationX: 0, y: 0)
        })
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Next, update table view code to use slide in animation. It produces visual effect like this:

<p align="center">
    <a href="{{ "/img/tableviewcell-display-animation/slide-in-animation.gif" | absolute_url }}">
        <img src="/img/tableviewcell-display-animation/slide-in-animation.gif" alt="Animating Table View Cell Display: Practical Recipes - Slide in Animation"/>
    </a>
