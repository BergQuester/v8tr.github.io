When developing iOS apps you rarely implement everything from the ground-up, because operating system as well as open source community offers large amount of functionality that the app needs in a form of library. A developer links the app with these libraries to get what they need, such as the ability to operate folders and files or draw on the screen. In this article let's explore static and dynamic libraries and frameworks which are the two major ways of packaging such building blocks of code in iOS.

### Introduction

UIKit, Foundation, WatchKit, GameKit, you name it - all of these are *frameworks* from *Apple standard library* and there are dozens more of them. Have you thought why Apple splits code into frameworks instead of exposing it to your app all at once?

Throughout the article we'll give an answer to this questions along with these ones:
- What is a framework?
- What is a library and how it differs from a framework?
- What are dynamic and static frameworks and libraries?

### What is a Framework?

### What is a Library?

### Why to Use Frameworks and Libraries

### Types of Frameworks and Libraries

### Static Linking
- how affects app startup time

### Dynamic Linking
- how affects app startup time
