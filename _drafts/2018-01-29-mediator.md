Programmers encounter same problems over and over again. The common solution to such problems, that is generic and reusable enough to be used millions of times, is called a design pattern. Lets have a closer look at a mediator pattern that is often unfairly left unnoticed, although it might become a significant tool in your arsenal.

### Mediator

#### Purpose

As already been said, a design pattern is a general solution to an occurring software engineering problem. Its neither code itself nor can be directly transformed into code. A design pattern is rather a template that describes **how** to solve a problem.

Mediator lends itself to solving following problems:
* Tight coupling of objects that directly interact with each other.
* Interaction logic is distributed among a set of objects and cannot be reused.
* Interaction logic is hard to test.
* Interaction logic cannot be changed independently.

#### Solution

Mediator object encapsulates the interaction policies in a hidden and unconstraining way. Objects being manipulated by mediator have no idea it exists. It sits quietly behind the scenes and imposes its policies without their permission or knowledge.

### Search History Mediator

Lets study Mediator by a real word example. Imagine, you are adding search history feature to your app's screen which already has search capabilities. Here is the use case description:
1. Show a list of latest search terms.
2. Add new terms to the list.
3. Preserve search terms across sessions.
