Although Swift does not support multiple inheritance, it offers rich API that provides possibility to simulate it. Let's take an in-depth look at multiple inheritance as an object-oriented concept and what options do we have with regards to multiple inheritance implementation in Swift.

### Programming Language is Just a Tool

<!-- Have you ever thought what is the starter point of your software design decisions? The answer on this question reveals the two basic ways of thinking that usually drive software design. -->

Speaking of programming as a way of thinking, have you even thought what drives your software design decisions? The answer on this question reveals the two basic approaches that are naturally the starter points of all programming decisions.

**Thinking from programming language perspective** - each problem is assessed based on the toolkit the programming language offers. The example of this way of thinking: "I am good at Swift generics, I'll keep using them as a solution to all emerging tasks". 

It is thinking like a hammer: everything becomes a nail to be hammered in, irrespective of how inappropriate it is.

**Thinking from the problems and their solutions perspective** - following this way of thinking, you translate the solution into the program. All programming languages have their pros and cons, thus such solution might not be perfect. Following this way of thinking, programming language becomes just a tool.

For example, Swift does not support atomic properties by default, but still offers rich locking API which you can utilize to implement such. In [Atomic Properties in Swift](http://www.vadimbulavin.com/atomic-properties/) I discuss this particular case in more details.

When put this way, it becomes obvious that the second way of thinking is much more productive, while the first should be omitted.

**Thinking from the problems and their solutions perspective** requires knowledge of basic programming idioms. *Multiple inheritance*, which is the subject of present article, is among such idioms.

### Multiple Inheritance in Swift

*Multiple inheritance* is an object-oriented concept in which a class can inherit behavior and attributes from more than one parent class. It is a way of sharing code between multiple classes.

*Multiple inheritance* is a standard feature of some programming languages, like C++.

 With regard to Swift, a class can conform to multiple protocols, but inherit from just one class. Value types, such as struct and enum, can conform to multiple protocols only.

<p align="center">
<i>Swift support multiple inheritance of interfaces but single inheritance of implementations.</i>
</p>

Let's explore what options do we have in relation to *multiple inheritance* in Swift.

### Implementing Multiple Inheritance in Swift

Protocols with default implementation become the main tool that provides the opportunity to simulate multiple inheritance. Here is how it looks like:

{% highlight swift linenos %}

protocol HelloPrinter {
    func sayHello()
}

extension HelloPrinter {
    func sayHello() {
        print("Hello")
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Now when you create a new type conforming to that protocol, it gets the implementation of `sayHello` for free:

{% highlight swift linenos %}

struct MyStruct: HelloPrinter {

}

let myStruct = MyStruct()
myStruct.print() // Prints "Hello"

{% endhighlight %}

You must already understand the pattern: we are going to incorporate independent pieces of functionality into protocols with default implementations. 

There is a term for this approach named *mixin*. 

### Mixins

A *mixin* is a class that contains methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes.

The idea behind *mixins* is simple: we would like to specify an extension without pre-determining what exactly it can extend. This is equivalent to specifying a subclass while leaving its superclass as a parameter to be determined later.

*Mixins* are generally not intended to be instantiated and used on their own. They provide the behavior that is supposed to be added to other types.

Here are the key points to understand about mixins:
- Can contain both behavior and state.
- Not supposed to be initialized.
- Specialized and narrow in its functionality.
- Not intended to be specialized any further by other *mixins*.

With the help of *mixins* we can approach multiple inheritance implementation in Swift very closely.

Now let's write some code.

### Implementing a Mixin

### Implementing Stateless Mixin

#### Flasher

#### LoadingAnimatable

### Implementing Statefull Mixin

### Diamond Problem

### Wrapping Up

Here is where the boundary between the inheritance and compositions begins to eradicate. Mixins are the basis for a compositional inheritance.
