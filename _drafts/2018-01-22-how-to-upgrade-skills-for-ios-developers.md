# How to upgrade skills for iOS developers

The distinctive feature of software development is rapid obsolence of tools and frameworks. Thus, we must constantly strive to refine and improve our skills to accomodate changes of information field and state of the market.

Mobile development is especially effected with this trend. Thereby, beginners must focus on fundamental skills rather than learning individual tools or frameworks.

### Study classic books

Must-read books:
* McConnel, S. Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, Second Edition.
* Martin, R. Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship.
* Fowler, Beck. Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code.
* Gamma et al. Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.

Nice to read:
* Hunt A., Thomas D.  The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master.
* Sonmez J. Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual.

The only Swift book you need is [The Swift Programming Language][swift-docs] by Apple. Also, there is a great video series that has become classic in a short term, which will be discussed further.

### Understand development methodologies

* Learn the difference between Waterfall and Agile development approaches. 
* Study Agile methodolies: Scrum, Kanban, XP.

### English > Swift

The first language you must learn is English, and not Swift or Objective-C, unless you are a native speaker. The essential minimum for reading documentation is level [B1](https://www.ielts.org/ielts-for-organisations/common-european-framework).

### Computer Science

You must be fluent in the following topics:

| Topic              | Competency                                                                             |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data structures    | Understand the concept and best usage cases of Arrays, Lists, Sets, Trees, Graphs.     |
| Alorithms          | Understand the principles of basic search and sorting algorithms. The concept of O(n). |
| System programming | Basic understanding of compilation process and memory management.                      |

### iOS

I recommend to study iOS in the following sequence:

1. Read through the [official Apple's book on Swift][swift-docs]. Don't try to remember everything, the main goal of this step is to get the overall understanding of the language. You will refine your practical skills following the next step.
2. Study [Developing iOS 11 Apps with Swift by Stanford University][standord-course] video course. It's the best practical course on iOS development and it's completely free. Type and run every example and by the end of the course you will confident enough to implement a full-fledge app on your own.

### Swift or Objective-C?

Undoubtly you must focus on studying Swift. All fresh projects use Swift and Objective-C now associates only with legacy code.

However, do not be under any illusion that you can avoid studying Objective-C. It has been in iOS world for a very long time and all Cocoa frameworks consist of Objective-C classes. From time to time you will have to dive into Objective-C code and this must contribute enough to your knowledge.

### Portfolio

Develop pet-projects. Come up with an idea that insipers you, implement it in an iOS application and pulbish it on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Aside from the invaluable experience you gain, it's a great advantage when finding a job not only for beginners, but even for seasoned develpers.

### Resume

Resume is often the first document that acquaints you with. Make every effort to compose it with the highest quality possible.

1. Use only English language.
2. Consider using 3rd-party services, such as [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/).
3. Always keep you resume up to date. Cloud storage or version control system will come in hand.
