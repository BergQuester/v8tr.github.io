Swift has no language features for defining atomic properties. However, the lack of @synchronized or atomic modifier that we used to in Objective-C is compensated with the diversity of locking APIs available in Apple's frameworks. In this article let's take a look at different ways of designing an atomic property in Swift.

- Definition of Lock
- Apple APIs
- Atomic properties

a. Before going straight to the code, lets look through the core concepts that will be used in the article.

b. When working with concurrent code, there are several concepts you must be aware of.

### Concurrency and Multitasking

**Concurrency** refers to the ability of different parts of a program to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome. 

This allows for **multitasking** which is a parallel execution of the concurrent units that significantly boosts performance of a program in multi-processor systems.

### Synchronization

In common sense, **synchronization** means making two things happen at the same time. 

In programming, **synchronization** has broader definition: it refers to relationships among events â€” any number of events, and any kind of relationship (before, during, after).

As programmers, we are often concerned with *synchronization constraints*, which are requirements pertaining to the order of events. Constraint example: *Events A and B must not happen at the same time*.

### Locks

When dealing with iOS apps, we are always sandboxed to their *processes*. A process creates and manages *threads*, which are the main building blocks in multitasking iOS applications.

**A lock** is an abstract concept for threads synchronization. The main idea is to protect access to a given region of code at a time. There are multiple types of locks:
1. **Semaphore** - allows up to *N* threads to access a given region of code at a time.
2. **Mutex** - ensures that only one thread is active in a given region of code at a time. You can think of it as a *semaphore* with a *maximum count of 1*.
3. **Spinlock** - causes a thread trying to acquire a lock to wait in a loop while checking if the lock is available. It is efficient if waiting is rare, but wasteful if waiting is common.
4. **Read-write lock** - provides concurrent access for *read-only* operations, but exclusive access for *write* operations. Efficient when reading is common, but writing is rare.
5. **Recursive lock** - a *mutex* that can be acquired by the same thread many times.

Now we can design atomic property using the above synchronization objects.

Next we will go through concrete implementations of these locks in Swift.

### Mutex and Recursive Lock

`NSLock` and its companion `NSRecursiveLock` are Objective-C lock classes. They correspond to *Mutex* and *Recursive Lock* and don't have their Swift counterparts. 

A lower-level C `pthread_mutex_t` is also available in Swift. It can be configures both as a mutex and a recursive lock.

### Spin Lock

Since iOS 10 `OSSpinLock` has been deprecated and now there is no exact match to spin lock concept in Apple's frameworks. The recommendation is to use `os_unfair_lock` for this purpose. This function doesn't spin on contention, but instead waits in the kernel to be awoken by an unlock. Thus, it has lower CPU impact than the spin lock does, but makes starvation of waiters a possibility.

### Read-write lock 

The lower-level C `pthread_rwlock_t` should be used in order to achieve read-write locking.

### Semaphore

`DispatchSemaphore` provides an implementation of a semaphore. Despite it makes little sense to use semaphore for designing atomic properties in Swift, it is an important concept in concurrent programming and is stated for completeness reasons.

### Dispatch Queue

Dispatch Queue is an abstraction used to manage the execution of work items.
