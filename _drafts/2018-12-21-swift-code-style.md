### Problem Statement

When joining a new project or reading an open source code, you must have noticed that some projects are uniformly organized and well-structured, while others are messy and tangled? If we summarize the factors that yields such effect over the code base, we come across the notion of *code convention*.

*Code convention* is a set of dos and don'ts which describe files organization, programming practices, design patterns, architectural approach, etc. 

*Code style* is a subset of *code conventions* that govern file formatting, such as indentation, position of commas, braces, etc. Historically, in *Swift* community the distinction between the two is not made and the common term *Swift code style* is used.

Undoubtedly, it takes time and efforts to adopt *Swift code style*. So, why is it important for a healthy project and should you bother about it or not?
<!-- By acknowledging that ubiquitous *code conventions* are highly important for a healthy Swift project, let's explore the following aspects of the subject:
- Which Swift guidelines exist?
- Which Swift guideline to pick for your project?
- How to adopt Swift code styles in your project? -->

### Why Bother with Code Conventions?

[According to Robert C. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/835238-indeed-the-ratio-of-time-spent-reading-versus-writing-is), we are spending over **10** times more time reading code versus writing and are constantly reading existing code to write the new one.

Every effort that improves readability contributes to programming productivity a lot and we always want to be as much productive as possible. 

Swift code style serves a number of definite purposes:
- Makes code easier to read and maintain.
- Allows for faster and better organized onboarding process for new team members.
- Allows for static analyzers based on accepted rules.
