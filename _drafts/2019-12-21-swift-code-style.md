### Problem Statement

When joining a new project, or reading an open source code, you must have noticed that some projects are well-organized, with their own structure and order, while others are messy and disorganized? In attempt to formalize, which factors apply their effect over code bases, yielding such results, we come across the notion of *code conventions*.

*Code conventions* are a set of dos and don'ts which describe files organization, programming practices, design patterns, architectural approach, etc. *Code style* is a subset of conventions that govern file formatting, such as indentation, position of commas, braces, etc.

These rules serve a number of purposes:
- Make code easier to read and maintain.
- Faster and better organized onboarding for new team members.
- Allow for static analyzers.
 
By acknowledging that ubiquitous *code conventions* are highly important for a healthy Swift project, let's explore the following aspects of the subject:
- Which Swift guidelines exist?
- Which Swift guideline to pick for your project?
- How to adopt Swift code styles in your project?
