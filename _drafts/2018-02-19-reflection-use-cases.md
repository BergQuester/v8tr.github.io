Although Swift is a statically typed language, there is a secret double life to Swiftâ€™s type system at runtime that paves the way to some dynamism. This allows to look at the types and the methods that we defined in our code and build higher abstractions on top of that. This technique is called Reflection. In this article we will have a look at Reflection and Mirror type as well as discuss several practical usage cases.

# Reflection and Mirror

Reflection is [defined][reflection-def] as the ability of a computer program to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime.

[Introspection][introspection-def], in turn, is the ability of a program to examine the type or properties of an object at runtime.

Swift's Reflection is limited, providing read-only access to a subset of type metadata. Such metadata is encapsulated in `Mirror` instances. Under the hood, `Mirror` crawls [witness tables][witness-table-def] or queries Objective-C runtime for Swift and Objective-C types respectively.

Reflection provides great opportunity to combine it's dynamic features together with Swift static type system. Let's see how our production code can benefit from bringing together these two approaches.

## JSON parsing

A well-known Reflection appliance in Swift is JSON parsing. Let's see the common approach:
