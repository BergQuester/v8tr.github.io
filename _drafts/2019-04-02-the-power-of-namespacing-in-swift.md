Namespacing is a powerful feature to improve code structure. Although being limited in Swift, it can be compensated with pseudo-namespaces. Let's take a look at how it works in Swift by default and how it can be simulated.

### Defining Namespace


**Namespace** is a named region of program used to group variable, types and methods. Namespacing has following benefits:
- Allows to improve code structure by organizing the elements, which otherwise would have global scope, into the local scopes. 
- Prevents name collision.
- Provides [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)).

### Implicit Namespacing in Swift

*Namespacing* is implicit in Swift, meaning that all types, variables (etc) are automatically scoped by the module, which, in its turn, corresponds to Xcode target.

Most of the time no module prefixes are needed to access a type from outer scope:

```swift
let zeroOrOne = Int.random(in: 0...1)
print(zeroOrOne) // Prints 0 or 1
```
Although `Int` is declared externally, the scope is figured implicitly.

### Explicit Namespacing in Swift

In case of name collision, system integer type is shadowed by the local one:

```swift
struct Int {}

let zeroOrOne = Int.random(in: 0...1) // error: type 'Int' has no member 'random'
```

To resolve the ambiguity, the namespace must be explicitly specified:

```swift
struct Int {}

let zeroOrOne = Swift.Int.random(in: 0...1)
let myInt = Article_Namespacing.Int.init()
```

`Swift` is the *namespace* for all foundation types and primitives, including `Int` [[1]](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation). `Article_Namespacing` is global *namespace* of current Xcode target.

Another possible case is collision of names from two external frameworks. Say, `FrameworkA` and `FrameworkB` both declare their own `Int` types, as depicted below:

<p align="center">
    <a href="{{ "/img/the-power-of-namespacing-in-swift/name-collision.png" | absolute_url }}">
        <img src="/img/the-power-of-namespacing-in-swift/name-collision.png" alt="The Power of Namespacing in Swift"/>
    </a>
</p>

The ambiguity cannot be resolved automatically:

```swift
import FrameworkA
import FrameworkB

print(Int.init()) // Oops, error: Ambiguous use of 'init()'
```

It is resolved by explicitly specifying namespaces:

```swift
import FrameworkA
import FrameworkB

print(FrameworkA.Int.init()) // Prints: FrameworkA
print(FrameworkB.Int.init()) // Prints: FrameworkB
```

Import statement has multiple lesser-known traits, which are worth to be discussed.

### Import Statement Grammar

**Import by sub-module**. Modules have hierarchial structure and could be composed of sub-modules [[2]](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html#introduction). It is possible to limit imported namespace to sub-modules:

```swift
import UIKit.NSAttributedString

func foo() -> UIView { // All good
    return UIView()
}
```

{: .box-note}
*`UIKit.NSAttributedString` imports the entire `UIKit`, and additionally `Foundation`, hence will not bring any benefits.*

**Import by symbol.** Only the imported symbol (and not the module that declares it) is made available in the current scope:

```swift
import class UIKit.NSAttributedString

func foo() -> UIView { // error: Use of undeclared type 'UIView'
    return UIView()
}
```

Full import statement grammar is [available at swift.org](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Declarations.html#grammar_import-path-identifier).

### Namespacing Techniques

The implicit per-module namespacing is often not enough to express complex code structures and provide better naming. Here is when `enum`s come to the rescue.

**Why enum?** Unlike structs, enums do not have synthesized initializers; unlike classes they do not allow for subclassing, which makes enums a perfect candidate to simulate a namespace. Let's see real-world usage scenarios.

**Better-organized constants**. Different ways to specify constants exist: global variables, properties, config files. To group constants in a consistent and easy-to-understand way, without polluting other scopes, a namespace can be created:

```swift
class ItemListViewController {
    ...
}

extension ItemListViewController {

    enum Constants {
        static let itemsPerPage = 7
        static let headerHeight: CGFloat = 60
    }
}
```

Imagine the constants are put into global scope. What their names could be? I guess, these names are close enough to reality: 

```swift
let itemListViewControllerItemsPerPage = 7
let itemListViewControllerHeaderHeight: CGFloat = 60
```

Those are difficult to read and type. No more cumbersome names. Compare with: 

```swift
ItemListViewController.Constants.itemsPerPage
ItemListViewController.Constants.headerHeight
```

**Factories**. The creation of objects often contains complex mapping, validations, special cases handling. Furthermore, many overloaded methods may exist for different scenarios. Namespaced factories provide handy way of keeping things together without polluting external scope:

```swift
struct Item {
    ...
}

extension Item {

    enum Factory {
        static func make(from anotherItem: AnotherItem) -> Item {
            // Complex computations to map AnotherItem into Item
            return Item(...)
        }
    }
}
```

Usage:

```swift
let anotherItem = AnotherItem()
let item = Item.Factory.make(from: anotherItem)
```

**Grouping by usage area**. Network layer often needs specialized models for requests and responses, which are not used anywhere else, hence are good candidates to be grouped into a namespace:

```swift
enum API {

    enum Request {

        struct UpdateItem {
            let id: Int
            let title: String
            let description: String
        }
    }

    enum Response {

        struct ItemList {
            let items: [Item]
            let page: Int
            let pageSize: Int
        }
    }
}
```
Such code is self-documented; global scope is not polluted with `Request` name, since it is ambiguous without a context.

### Summary

The importance of good code structure is difficult to overestimate. Namespacing improves code structure by grouping relevant elements into local scopes and makes code self-documented.

Swift has limited built-in support for namespacing, which can be compensated by placing elements into `enum`s as pseudo-namespaces.
