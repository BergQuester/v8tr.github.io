I’m an iOS developer from Kharkiv, Ukraine. I hold a Master of Information Systems Security from [Kharkiv National University](http://nure.ua/en/) with a focus on Cryptography and Math. Currently I work at [TEAM International](https://www.teaminternational.com/).

I have been programming since 2010, professionally since 2013. During this period I developed over 25 iOS apps and games, some of which you will find on [LinkedIn][my-linkedin-profile]. I am enthusiast of TDD, Clean Architecture and always apply best development practices in every project.

I'm a husband and a father. When I’m not programming, you can find me playing with my daughter or working out in a gym.

Apart from software development, I enjoy politology, sociology, psychology and history.
